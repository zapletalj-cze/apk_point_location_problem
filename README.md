# Algorithms of Computational Cartography
# Polygon and Point Position Allocation Problem

## Description

This project is part of a school assignment focusing on comparing the allocation of a polygon in the plane and a given point. The project utilizes Ray Crossing and Winding Number algorithms to determine the position of a point compared to the polygon.

## Features
The project includes a graphical user interface created using the PyQt6 library. The user can input a custom polygon and point, and the application will evaluate whether the point is inside, outside, or on the boundary of the polygon.

## Repository Contents
- `main.py`: Main file containing the GUI application and position comparison logic.
- `algorithms.py`: File containing implementations of Ray Crossing and Winding Number algorithms.
- `draw.py`: Additional file for drawing objects in the widget.
- `convert.bat`: Batch file to create the GUI.
- `admin_level_7_czechia_UTM.shp`: Input data containing the boundaries of Czech Republic districts.
- `apk_report_01.pdf`: Report document titled "apk_report_01" detailing the project in Czech.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.12 and the PyQt6 library installed.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run `MainForm.py` using a Python interpreter.
4. Once the application is launched, you can input your own polygon and point for evaluation.
